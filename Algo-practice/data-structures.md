## BFS and DFS - Graph Traversal algorithm

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKY4hjDrxk)

### BFS
- In BFS - visit a vertex and explore all connected vertex then visit other vertex and explore all connected vertex for that node and so on
- BFS - uses queue DS
- In tree - BFS is level order traversal
- Slower
- Good to use BFS when solution is near to source
- BFS spanning tree

### DFS
- In DFS - visit a vertex and explore next connected vertex and so on untill u get no conneted node
- BFS - uses stack DS
- In tree - DFS is level pre-order traversal
- Faster
- Good if solution is away from source
- DFS spanning tree
- dotted lines are back edges
